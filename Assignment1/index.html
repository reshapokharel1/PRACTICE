    <p> Your coffee needs a coffee to deal with you. <br>
        You plan to “stay organized” and then alphabetize your fridge. <br>
        When you say “I’ll think about it,” the universe laughs and hits “pause.”<br>
        Your sense of direction is so bad, even Google Maps gives up. <br>
        Your confidence is like your screen brightness at 3 AM—blinding, but painful. <br>
        Your brain has the speed of light—with buffering. <br>
You don’t overshare, you narrate your life like it’s a podcast. <br>
Your ‘to-do’ list is a series of hope and empty promises. <br>
Even your phone battery drains faster than your patience. <br>
And somehow, you’re still iconic. A mess, but make it legendary.

<p>This is my favorite video on YouTube.
    It's a beautiful song written by Maha Kavi Laxmi Prasad Devkota that deeply emphasizes the reality of life.
    Truly a touching and meaningful piece.
It reflects the raw, unfiltered truths of life</p>
